# Hi, I'm Udita Gowdety 🌏  

💡 **Creative Technologist | Design Researcher**  
I work at the intersections of **Art, Science, Technology, Design, and Culture** — where the weird lives and the future begins.  

I’m interested in how humans build meaning into machines, and how machines, in turn, shape us. My work spans **Speculative Design, Human–AI Interaction, Storytelling, and Immersive Art.** Sometimes that means training small language models on my own journals, and sometimes that means creating generative simulations in TouchDesigner that feel like a love letter to code.
